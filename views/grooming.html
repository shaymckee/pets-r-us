        My pup and I had an excellent experience at Pets-R-Us. Everything was clean, calm and well-kept and she came home looking and feeling great! Highly recommend this pet groomer!

        Pets-R-Us always does an amazing job with our chihuahua and our German shepherd puppy! We recently went out of town and they boarded our dogs. The dogs were given great care and they were groomed when we picked them up.
