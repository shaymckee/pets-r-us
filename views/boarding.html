      <p class="companyinfo">
        Our affordable and luxurious services were crafted with a focus on luxury, relaxation, and privacy in mind. This is what makes Pets-R-Us a one-of-a-kind dog hotel and your top choice for Omaha dog boarding.
When you and your pet first step into our facility, you will enter an entirely new experience where you are greeted and cared for like family.
Best of all, the level of luxury and attention is competitive and affordable.
While most other boarding facilities in town charge for basic services such as play time, we have the policy of "no hidden fees".
When your dog stays with us, you get the same luxurious and attentive care All the Time, Every Time.
