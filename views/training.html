        Dogs are very intelligent and experts at reading our temperament. However, they are not programmable devices and take time to train properly. We work with owners because they are the biggest influence that they interact with every single day.
There is no magic or quick fix that can bring about the positive change that only training of both dog and owner can.
Our trainers share their knowledge of canine behavior and psychology to ensure ongoing improvement and efficient training for years to come; They will educate you, the owner, to understand why your dog behaves the way he or she does and offer the optimal solution of what needs to be done to permanently improve it. This eliminates the need to constantly correct bad behavior and instead focuses on positive reinforcement that requires less correction from dog owners. Earning in your dog's trust and respect can help you to understand and bond with your dog faster and easier without pain or intimidation.
Our method of working with your dog does not include bribes, such as food or treats. Instead, our trainers teach you how to properly reward your dog with toys, food, water, and love.
If you agree with our methods, we can teach you and your dog how to work together in a way that lasts. Sign up now!
